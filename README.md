 # iHeartMedia - Music Lab - Code Challenge

Submitted by Qian He

### To run locally -

`cd /graphql-server`

`node index.js`

`cd ../musiclab`

`npm start`

And that's it, the music-backend lambda is hosted on AWS for convenience -> https://cjvbui0tqi.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/Prod/songs/

The songData.json is stored in S3 -> https://musiclab-codechallenge.s3.amazonaws.com/songData.json
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Create a React application that shows a list of songs with their information and metrics displayed. The app should have at least **2 pages (views)**:
A landing page, and a page to show data coming from an API.

- Use typescript and graphql for everything where applicable.

- Fork this repo and share the link when you are finished!

### UI Checklist

- [ ] Create a React App using functional based components and hooks. No class based components, please.

- [ ] Create 2 views ( pages ) using React Router.

- [ ] Create a page that renders a table displaying a list songs coming from the API. Each row is a song, each column is a song attribute. 
 
   - [ ] Do not use `table` tags

- [ ] Employ **some** styling but it doesn't have to be much. You can use the styled-components library but do not use any other styling help.

- [ ] Allow the user to scroll vertically and horizontally through columns and rows that go off screen.

- [ ] Allow the user to sort the order of the song rows by the column values.

- [ ] It **does not** need to be mobile responsive.

### API Checklist

- [ ] Store the included JSON file in an S3 bucket and use the AWS SAM CLI with a **node.js** lambda function to serve the frontend with the data.

- Authentication is not necessary.

- You do not need to deploy or host this anywhere.

- SAM CLI instructions: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-install.html
